  - Various formatting changes website wide.
  - Reworked user filter logic in User Management panel to be more efficient.
  - Reworked cell size on user management table to be more compact.
  - Reworked training session/request panel for students
      - There was a lot of backend changes to process that should optimize things
        on the student side. Too lazy to type out all of the backend changes.

  - Disabled 'SPOTs' button in User Management panel w/ tooltip for dev.
  - Completely redesigned bid system
  - Added backend API workflow to handle bid finalization

    too lazy to explain)

    versus instructor claimed sessions.
  - Added ability for instructors to create session notes from claimed sessions.
      - Added backend feature that will associate availability records with training
        session records for administrative tracking. (Probably another use case but, again
        lazy...)

    in cell one.

    backend, etc.)
